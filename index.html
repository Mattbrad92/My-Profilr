My name is <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/matthew.bradley.9"> Matthew Bradley </a></em>and I decided that 3 months ago I needed a change of career, I am currently working for my families company building roads all over Australia. I have been working as a supervisor for three years now and although I have been very lucky with my progression in the company it is time to do what I am passionate about.  IT has always been an challenge that has interested me. I have a stubborn personality, with a desire to problem solve, I won’t let a problem stop me for making something work,
I live with my partner Pip and our 2 dogs, Boots, a dachshund cross German pointer and the chunky one in the photo is my Labrador Minnie , most of our weekends are taking the dogs on adventures mostly to the beach in the 4wd. Pip and I have been together for 9 years now and have been lucky enough to travel all around Europe and the United Kingdom together. Our goal is to see a lot more of the world together.

<p>


My interest in IT has been in me before I even realised what IT was, I have a pure love for efficiency, getting systems to work in an easy and effective manner and the best way to get the most out of systems is through the latest technology. So, I always have my eye on the latest and greatest.
If I had to select a definitive moment that really pulled me into the world it would be only 12 months ago when my employer decided to make all of their  current Forms and procedures digital which required someone to design them, I volunteered and absolutely love it, the system I used is called Gocanas, there is no coding required in this application and it was very simple to use. I genuinely enjoyed the process, but I still felt a frustration as I was restricted to the limits of the APP. I want the knowledge to be able to perfect the system to make it as efficient as possible. Later that week I started to research what Is need to turn this into a Career and I came across open universities.
I never thought it was possible to study whist at work, but with a little research I came across open universities Australia which then went onto RMIT. With the study method being 100% online this is going to be my best chance move in the direction I have wanted to for years.
The main Lesson I want to learn is just how. How everything in the computer World works, from the software to the hardware and everything in between, Getting the opportunity to talk with people that currently work in the field and gather firsthand experience. I am Hoping to Dip my toe into the many “branches” that are on offer and see what really takes my interest. My eye is drawn now to cyber security, and robotic.

<p>
This job really draws my attention as the company itself is not an “IT” company but it has and IT department I feel as at this moment I know about the end product they are selling as well as the general clientele, I feel as one I achieve the skills required I could help develop systems and make it as efficient as possible.
There will be experience needed in a few area such as .net framework (back end) so experience in languages  such as Python and java will be necessary, There will also be some front end  development so HTML, JavaScript and CSS will be a must. Also, Azure is the Cloud storage system that this employer has selected to use, so a familiarity with this will work in my favour. Lots of team work will be done through the Scrum, in this collaration tool we will work in the sprint system to get the most out of the team.
The current job I wish to enter is not within my current skillset as I am new to coding and am not yet qualified for this position. But I believe over the next year I will complete my degree of Information technology at  RMIT university Giving myself  a great base to start with. Then gaining employment with some experienced personal where I can continue to learn through the experience of others. Then once working in the field I will start my Bachelor of Computer Science.

  Assertive Executive is the result in my <em><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/9d678072687d1" >16 personalities test, </a> </em> this is no surprise to me as I am quite assertive in my day-to-day operations, I enjoy leading from the front, which is one of my flaws, in the lack of emotion when it comes to decision making. A big surprise for myself is my learning style, being tactile which only 5% of people are, I always thought I was a visual learner, but this outcome makes complete sense. I learn from doing, not from reading, learning on the job has always been my preferred method of learning I redid this test three times on three different sites and they all came back the same result. I’ve never considered myself a creative person in any aspect and this result of the creativity test has proved me right, making this look pretty has never been my top priority, a functional product makes more sense than a pretty one. The optimal team for myself is to work with creative assertive people. Creative to upskill myself as it is an area I struggle with. Assertive so I don’t take control and their ideas are lost due to not being able to communicate them to myself. With myself learning to make a step back and allow people to teach me. Whilst still having a hands on approach to allow for me to learn and develop.

<p>
  Subcriptions, in the world we Live in today most companies offer a yearly subscription or pay as you go service. Most Australian people will have the following,
  <ol>
    <li>Netflix (6 Million Australians)</li>
    <li>Stan  (2.3 Million Australians) </li>
    <li>Amazon (175 million subscribers Worldwide)</li>
    <li>Spotify (172 million premium subscribers worldwide)</li>
    <li>Apple + (35.6 million subscribers worldwide</li>
With many more having:
  <ul>
    <li>Audible</li>
    <li>Binge</li>
    <li>Apple music </li>
    <li>Amazon music </li>
    <li>Youtube music</li>
</ul>
Just to name the Entertainment sector there are also many food-based subscription such as
  <ul>
    <li>Hellofresh</li>
    <li>My muscle chef </li>
    <li>Youfoodz</li>
    <li>Dinnerly</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also the 1000’s of subscriptions offered in the apple store and google play store. Keeping track of all this can becoming annoying and inconvenient, going through multiple cancel pages or register pages only to verify your email multiple times and come up with different passwords for each account this is where SUBMANGER APP/webpage is your one stop shop.
</p>
<p>
  Once reading this you start to count how many subscriptions you may have and the number for many will go into the double digits. I want to create a space that allows a user to view, cancel, continue, pause, resume all of the subscription in one place. The idea would allow a user to create an account in an app or webpage that allows you to enter in multiple emails that have been linked to the subscriptions. The user will then enter in all subscriptions with passwords into the app where they can then be managed, Allowing a view of all active subscriptions as well as all inactive subscriptions in red. If an inactive subscription is selected but has been used before, all the account details will have been saved so a re-subscription has been selected it is as simple as a few clicks in the app then you are now a subscriber again. One option that would attract people to download this as appose to going straight to the official website and subscribing is a scheduled cancel of the plan within the app. this being done by, when starting the subscription offering people the option of an end date that the app will automatically cancel that particular subscription. If an active subscription is selected there will be an option of pause for a month, which will do exactly that and pause subscription for a month. The option to cancel. Once the cancel is selected the account will be cancelled making sure that the remaining term already paid for continues. Then moved into the red section of inactive SUBS. All programs that have subscriptions will be on a drop-down menu ready to add to the NEW section of the app, this is where any new subscriptions will be entered once a new Subscription is added it will take you to a new page on the app where all of your details are already pre-entered ready for you to edit or continue. Once continued you will be redirected to for example spotify’s register page where all your details have already been entered only needing your bank details to run through Spotify account system once payment is complete you will be directed back to app where the Spotify is green in active ready to use. This system will make it very easy to budget in for entertainment as there will be a total cost summary at the bottom showing the total cost of all the accounts. I would also incorporate a section of the app that can help the elderly generation. Technology has moved very quickly in recent years and I like many others my age spent countless hours on the phone trying to set up subscription for my elderly relatives. This app will allow for a single set up allowing someone who is experienced with apps to set up once and all the information is saved so with a phone call to that person you can be easily walked through the steps on cancelling or starting a subscription. The possibility of big companies such as Netflix, Disney, STAN etc wanting this APP to fail Could be quite high as they may rely on the process being somewhat complicated to cancel causing Netflix to  retain viewers and increase their growth. So there cooperation may be needed making of this application.
</p>
<p>
  HTML, JavaScript, CSS, will be used in the front-end development of this app/ website giving it some content features and design aspects and as this is a dynamic website, frameworks will be a vital tool in the development of the application. Testing of this application before its release is paramount, fixing all bugs. The main aspect of this idea is simplicity, an allowance of qualified APP testers is necessary to ensure a smooth platform when crossing between frameworks.
</p>
<p>
  A computer science degree is recommended when looking at Application development As there is an array of skills need. They are many coding languages that I will need to become familiar with such as python, JavaScript, c++, Probably the most important aspect of the App will be the UI (User Interface) there are many familiar to the eye templates available.  Since they will be sensitive information available, security must be taken seriously, the study of ethical hacking would be optimal. Once the application is ready it shall be test through an offensive cyber-attack, skills in these programmes to effectively try and hack into the APP with permission is a great way for testing of the security

</P>
<p>
  If this APP became a success, it could have a massive impact of the content that is shown to try and grab subscriptions by making it so easy to cancel, there will be more fierce competition for the providers to create more popular content trying to retain and grow SUBS and stop people cancelling. While yes it may have people cancel it has the possibility to bring in new viewers with the ease of only clicking a few buttons. Bringing on board the older generation as well.
